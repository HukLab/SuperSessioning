#SuperSessioning
a toolbox for cross session sorting of neural data

##Scope
####Technical
- Characterize local minima in the voltage traces across the array, and obtain an estimate of overall recording quality.
- Establish a metric for individual spikes for cross session comparisons, which is robust to additive noise.
- Use a minimal temporal windows for sorting and reduce overlap between spikes

####Experimental
- Chronically implanted electrode arrays in awake behaving animals, with no or little electrode drift across recording sessions.
- Sorting on individual electrodes, assuming electrode distances >100 Âµm
- Perform clustering in a noise dependent way, and ignore bouts of high noise across the array in the clustering step.
- visualize 

##Overview of the toolbox
- roughly split into single session and cross session analysis
- use one .mat file to keep track of parameters, files etc. across sessions
- same file keeps track of which sessions have been merged

####Operating modes
- (TODO) function that (currently) does detection and sorting for single sessions only, plus RecordingExtractors and SortingExtractors, for integration with [SpikeInterface](https://github.com/SpikeInterface).
- (TODO) function that does the sorting for one recording session, without merging.
- script for stepwise analysis, and session merges: SortMaster.m

## Detection and sorting pipeline
1. **extract Data and recording parameter**
 	- extractDataFromKwik.m
	- manuallyAnnotatedHdf
[//]: # (1. (**test for potential amplifier recalibrations**))
[//]: # (	- StepTest (TODO))
1. **remove 60 Hz component**
	- filter60Hz
1. **common average referencing**
	- filterCAR
1. **determine signal variance**
and determine segments of low variance
	- estimateStd
1. **match templates**
and obtain 3D densities of local minima
	- blindTemplateMatching
1. **find clusters**
use only segments with 'low' variance
	- clusterSession

### Matching across sessions
1. **match across sessions**
	- mergeAll
	-mergeNext
	-mergeHash
